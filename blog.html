    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Being a Dungeon Master (DM) is more than just storytelling—it's a day-long mental workout. From morning planning sessions to the chaos of evening combat, a DM crafts immersive experiences for players while managing multiple moving parts. This visual essay walks you through a full day in the life of a Dungeon Master, broken into three segments: Morning Prep, Afternoon Design, and Game Night Mayhem.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="sequence" id="morning">
    <h2>Morning Prep</h2>
    <img src="images/notes-coffee.jpg" alt="DM notes and coffee" />
    <p>The day starts with coffee and scribbled notes from the night before. Plot arcs, random encounters, and NPC quirks are refined while the house is quiet. It’s the calm before the storm.
    <br><strong>Challenge Level:</strong> ★☆☆☆☆</p>

    <img src="images/books-open.jpg" alt="DM flipping through rulebooks" />
    <p>Time to cross-check rulebooks. That goblin ambush? It needs to follow the rules—at least loosely. The balance of structure and improvisation begins here.
    <br><strong>Fun Factor:</strong> ★★★☆☆</p>
  </section>

  <section class="sequence" id="afternoon">
    <h2>Afternoon Design</h2>
    <img src="images/map-drawing.jpg" alt="hand-drawn dungeon map" />
    <p>World-building ramps up in the afternoon. Custom maps, mysterious artifacts, and twisted riddles take shape. Each detail feeds immersion.
    <br><strong>Creativity Level:</strong> ★★★★★</p>

    <img src="images/npc-cards.jpg" alt="index cards with NPC names" />
    <p>Index cards with NPCs and their goals help organize the chaos. Will the players meet the shady barkeep? Or skip town completely? Planning for uncertainty is part of the job.
    <br><strong>Preparedness:</strong> ★★★★☆</p>
  </section>

  <section class="sequence" id="evening">
    <h2>Game Night Mayhem</h2>
    <img src="images/tabletop-setup.jpg" alt="players gathered around a tabletop game" />
    <p>The players arrive. The table is set. Dice clatter. Snacks disappear. Players derail the plot within the first 10 minutes. Time to improvise.
    <br><strong>Stress Level:</strong> ★★★★★</p>

    <img src="images/battle-map.jpg" alt="combat battle map with figures" />
    <p>Combat ensues. The goblin ambush is now a full-scale siege. Players argue over spell mechanics. You juggle rules, roleplay, and resource tracking—simultaneously.
    <br><strong>Focus Required:</strong> ★★★★☆</p>

    <img src="images/post-game.jpg" alt="DM alone after the game" />
    <p>The session ends. Players leave happy, but you sit in silence among crumpled notes and cookie crumbs. It’s quiet again.
    <br><strong>Exhaustion:</strong> ★★★★☆</p>
  </section>

  <section class="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Being a DM is hard—but rewarding. Players remember your world. They laugh at your jokes. They feel tension during your twists. You are the architect of memory. And tomorrow, you do it all again—but this time, there’s a dragon.</p>
