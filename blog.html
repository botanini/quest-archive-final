    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Being a Dungeon Master (DM) is more than just storytelling. It's a day-long mental workout. From waking up and morning planning, buying snacks for the others, to the chaos of evening combat, being a DM isn't an easy job. Dungeon Masters craft immersive experiences for players while managing multiple moving parts. This visual essay walks you through a full day in the life of a Dungeon Master, broken into three segments: Waking up feeling fantastical, Afternoon Setup, and Game Night Mayhem.</p>

  <section class="sequence" id="morning">
    <h2>Waking up feeling fantastical...</h2>
    <img src="images/Untitled_Artwork-1.png" alt="DM notes and coffee" />
    <p>The day starts with coffee and some scribbled notes from the night before. Plot arcs, random encounters, and NPC quirks are refined while the house is quiet. It’s the calm before the storm. For today the group is finally able to gather and engage in a session.
    <br><strong>Challenge Level:</strong> ★☆☆☆☆</p>

    <img src="images/Untitled_Artwork-2.png" alt="DM checking and writing notes" />
    <p>Time to cross-check notes. See what details I might want to have and see what story our party will encounter later today.
    <br><strong>Brainnumbing:</strong> ★★★☆☆</p>

  <section class="sequence" id="afternoon">
    <h2>Afternoon Setup</h2>
    <img src="images/Untitled_Artwork-3.png" alt="grocery shopping" />
    <p>Grocery shopping for snacks. The party needs fuel for the adventure ahead. Chips, soda, and pizza are essential. 
    <br><strong>Creativity Level:</strong> ★★★★★</p>

    <img src="images/Untitled_Artwork-4.png" alt="table setup" />
    <p>Index cards with NPCs and their goals help organize the chaos. Will the players meet the shady barkeep? Or skip town completely? Planning for uncertainty is part of the job.
    <br><strong>Preparedness:</strong> ★★★★☆</p>

  <section class="sequence" id="evening">
    <h2>Game Night Mayhem</h2>
    <img src="images/Untitled_Artwork-5.png" alt="players arriving at the house" />
    <p>The players arrive. The table is set. Dice clatter. Snacks disappear. Players derail the plot within the first 10 minutes. Time to improvise.
    <br><strong>Stress Level:</strong> ★★★★★</p>

    <img src="images/Untitled_Artwork-6.png" alt="combat battle map with figures" />
    <p>Combat ensues. The goblin ambush is now a full-scale siege. Players roll their dice seeing if their attack connect. Players argue over spell mechanics. You juggle rules, roleplay, and resource tracking—simultaneously. Making sure that you don't accidentally kill someone.
    <br><strong>Focus Required:</strong> ★★★★☆</p>

    <img src="images/Untitled_Artwork-7.png" alt="DM alone after the game" />
    <p>The session ends. Players leave happy, but you sit in silence among crumpled notes and cookie crumbs. It’s quiet again.
    <br><strong>Exhaustion:</strong> ★★★★☆</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Being a DM is draining but also fun. You get to use your imagination and spend time with those that you love. Even if schedules don't always align. Everyday tha </p>
