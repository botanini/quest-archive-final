					<h2>New to Dungeons & Dragons?</h2>
					<p>
						This starter kit is here to help you take your first steps into the
						world of adventuring.
					</p>
					<p>
						Whether you're building your first character or preparing to DM a
						one-shot, we've gathered essential tools, guides, and tips to get
						you going without overwhelmed.
					</p>
					<p>Here's what every beginner should have in their pack.</p>
				</section>

				<!-- Section 1: Core Supplies -->
				<section class="starter-section">
					<h2>Essential Supplies</h2>
					<ul class="starter-kit-list">
						<li>
							<strong>Set of Dice:</strong> A standard 7-piece polyhedral set
							(d20, d12, d10, d8, d6, d4, and percentile).
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Character Sheet:</strong> Paper or digital form to track
							stats, inventory, spells, and traits.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Pencil:</strong> A humble yet powerful tool for edits and
							erasures during play.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Player’s Handbook (PHB):</strong> Physical or digital
							version; even a free basic rules PDF works!
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>D&D Beyond Account:</strong> Recommended for digital
							character creation and rules lookup.
							<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/" target="_blank"

				</section>

				<!-- Section 2: Helpful Resources -->
				<section class="starter-section">
					<h2>Helpful Resources</h2>
					<ul class="starter-kit-list">
						<li>
							<strong>Intro to Classes:</strong> Unsure who to play? Try a
							Fighter for simplicity or a Cleric for flexibility.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Session Zero Checklist:</strong> Establish expectations,
							tone, and rules with your group before play.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>How Combat Works:</strong> Learn initiative, actions, and
							turns to keep battles smooth.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Roleplaying Tips:</strong> Speak in character, ask
							questions, and be curious — not perfect!
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>One-Shot Module:</strong> Try a prewritten short adventure
							like “The Wild Sheep Chase” or “Frozen Sick.”
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<!-- Section 3: What to Expect -->
				<section class="starter-section">
					<h2>What to Expect in Your First Game</h2>
					<p>
						Your first session might be chaotic — and that’s okay! Expect
						laughter, weird dice rolls, and creative problem solving.
					</p>
					<p>
						Don’t worry about mastering the rules immediately; focus on enjoying
						the story and contributing to the fun. D&D is about collaborative
						storytelling, and your imagination is the most important item in
						your kit.
