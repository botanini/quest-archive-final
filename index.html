            <strong>Into the Dungeon</strong> is a digital hub for adventurers,
            storytellers, and curious newcomers eager to explore the world of
            Dungeons & Dragons. This site isn’t focused on rules, mechanics, or
            stats — instead, it celebrates the experience of being part of the
            D&D community.
          </p>
          <p class="intro-text">Whether you’ve played for years or are just rolling your first d20,
            our content offers a glimpse into what it means to be a player
            today. We feature reviews of tools and media like D&D Beyond and
            Baldur’s Gate 3, photo galleries of the many trinkets of the
            fantastical worlds, and guides to help you start your own campaign.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">We also highlight the creativity of the community — from character
              art and campaign stories to fan-inspired media and memorable moments
              at the table. Into the Dungeon invites you to discover how modern
              players keep the magic of D&D alive, both online and in person. Come
              roll with us!</p>
