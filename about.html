                <em>Into the Dungeon</em> began in early 2025 as a creative capstone
                project by a group of D&D fans who wanted to make an accessible,
                visually rich resource for new and veteran players alike. What started
                as a digital magazine featuring dice reviews and class summaries
                quickly evolved into a collaborative archive of community creativity,
                player profiles, and campaign tools.

              <p>
                From our humble beginnings sketching potion bottles and character
                sheets, we've grown into a small but dedicated team curating original
                content, visual guides, and roleplay inspiration for fellow
                adventurers across the internet. Our timeline below highlights some
                major milestones in the development of this project:
